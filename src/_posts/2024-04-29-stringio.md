You can use the `StringIO` class to create IO objects which are backed by an
in-memory string.

One use case for this is unit-testing where you need to attach a file using
ActiveStorage. One of the ways you can attach data to the record is by
supplying the `attach` method with an `io` object. Using `StringIO.new` you can
create an `io` object using a string.

```ruby
invoice.hardcopy.attach(io: StringIO.new("Services: $200"),
                        filename: "invoice.txt",
                        content_type: "txt")
```

Using this technique, you can avoid creating and accessing a file on disk, which
would slow down your test.
